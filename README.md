# Noble Reads
A beautiful way to reads the classics.

Noble Reads is a side project of mine and my first attempt at learning JS. I focused on creating a clean and adaptable reading experience for both desktop and mobile with a few minimal interface options. 

Exploration includes text highlighting, text resizing, night/day reading modes as well as a responsive layout.
